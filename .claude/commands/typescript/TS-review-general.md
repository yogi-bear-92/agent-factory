# General TypeScript/Astro Codebase Review

Perform a comprehensive review of the entire TypeScript/Astro codebase focusing on architecture, patterns, and best practices.

Review scope: $ARGUMENTS

If no specific scope provided, review the entire codebase.

## Review Process

1. **Codebase Analysis**
   - Analyze overall project structure and architecture
   - Review component organization and modularity
   - Check for consistency across the codebase
   - Identify technical debt and improvement opportunities

2. **Pattern Consistency**
   - Ensure consistent use of Astro patterns
   - Validate TypeScript usage across files
   - Check for consistent naming conventions
   - Review import/export patterns

3. **Performance Assessment**
   - Evaluate bundle size and optimization
   - Review hydration strategy implementation
   - Check for unnecessary client-side JavaScript
   - Assess image optimization usage

## Review Focus Areas

### 1. **Architecture & Structure**
   - Islands Architecture implementation
   - Component organization (static vs interactive)
   - Content collections structure
   - API routes organization
   - Proper separation of concerns

### 2. **TypeScript Quality**
   - Strict mode compliance across all files
   - Type safety and explicit typing
   - Interface definitions and exports
   - Proper use of Astro's built-in types
   - Generic usage and constraints

### 3. **Astro-Specific Patterns**
   - Hydration directives usage patterns
   - Static-first approach implementation
   - Server islands configuration
   - Content management patterns
   - Framework integration consistency

### 4. **Performance & Optimization**
   - Bundle analysis and optimization
   - Image optimization implementation
   - Code splitting and lazy loading
   - Unnecessary JavaScript elimination
   - Hydration strategy effectiveness

### 5. **Security & Validation**
   - Environment variable management
   - Content Security Policy implementation
   - Input validation patterns
   - API security measures
   - Zod schema consistency

### 6. **Code Quality Standards**
   - Component size limits (200 lines Astro, 500 lines max)
   - Function complexity and length
   - Code duplication assessment
   - Error handling patterns
   - Logging and debugging practices

### 7. **Testing Coverage**
   - Vitest configuration and usage
   - Component test coverage
   - API route testing
   - Integration test quality
   - Mock usage patterns

### 8. **Dependencies & Tooling**
   - pnpm usage compliance
   - Dependency management
   - Build configuration
   - Development tooling setup
   - Integration configurations

### 9. **Documentation & Maintenance**
   - Code documentation quality
   - README completeness
   - Component prop documentation
   - API documentation
   - CLAUDE.md updates

### 10. **Standards Compliance**
   - ESLint configuration and compliance
   - Prettier formatting consistency
   - TypeScript strict mode adherence
   - Build process compliance
   - Pre-commit hook effectiveness
