# Hackathon Multi-Option Research

Rapidly evaluate multiple solution approaches for hackathon challenges using massive parallel research (15 concurrent agents).

## Problem/Challenge: $ARGUMENTS

## Phase 1: Problem Analysis & Option Generation

### Problem Breakdown
Analyze the challenge statement for:
- Core requirements and constraints
- Success criteria and evaluation metrics
- Available time and resources
- Technical constraints and preferences
- Target users and use cases

### Solution Approach Generation

Generate 3 distinct solution approaches:

#### Option A: Speed-First Approach
- **Philosophy**: "Ship fast, iterate later"
- **Strategy**: Leverage existing tools, proven patterns, minimal custom code
- **Target**: Working prototype in minimal time
- **Trade-offs**: May sacrifice innovation for speed

#### Option B: Innovation-First Approach  
- **Philosophy**: "Breakthrough solution with novel approach"
- **Strategy**: Cutting-edge tech, unique architecture, creative problem-solving
- **Target**: High-impact, differentiated solution
- **Trade-offs**: Higher risk, potentially longer development time

#### Option C: Balanced Approach
- **Philosophy**: "Solid foundation with strategic innovation"
- **Strategy**: Proven base with selective modern enhancements
- **Target**: Reliable solution with competitive advantages
- **Trade-offs**: Moderate risk, moderate innovation

## Phase 2: Massive Parallel Research (15 Agents)

**CRITICAL**: Execute all 15 research agents simultaneously using multiple Agent tool calls in a single response for maximum efficiency.

**OUTPUT STRUCTURE**: Create separate files for organized research review:
- Individual agent outputs: `PRPs/research/{option}-agent-{id}-{area}.md`
- Synthesized option analysis: `PRPs/research/{option}-synthesized-output.md`  
- Final recommendations: `PRPs/research/final-recommendations-analysis.md`

**IMPORTANT**: Create the `PRPs/research/` directory first if it doesn't exist.

### Implementation Handoff
The final recommendations file should contain:
- [ ] Clear winner with implementation roadmap
- [ ] Hour-by-hour development timeline  
- [ ] Technical architecture specifications
- [ ] Risk mitigation strategies
- [ ] Decision checkpoints and pivot criteria
- [ ] Success metrics and demo criteria

### Execution Success Criteria
- [ ] **19 Total Files Created**: 15 individual agent research + 3 synthesis + 1 final recommendations
- [ ] **Quantitative Decision**: Winner selected based on weighted scoring, not intuition
- [ ] **Implementation Ready**: Detailed roadmap with hour-by-hour timeline and specific tasks
- [ ] **Risk Aware**: Contingency plans and decision checkpoints defined
- [ ] **Team Aligned**: Clear roles, responsibilities, and coordination strategy
