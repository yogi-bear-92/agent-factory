# Execute Parallel React POCs

## POC Directory: $ARGUMENTS

Usage: `/prp-poc-execute-parallel [poc_directory_pattern]`
Example: `/prp-poc-execute-parallel "PRPs/poc-dashboard-*"`

## Mission: Parallel POC Implementation Success

Transform multiple React POC PRPs into working demonstrations simultaneously through **coordinated parallel execution** using specialized UI/UX and User Journey agents.

**Critical Understanding**: Each POC requires specialized execution:
- **UI-focused implementation** leveraging @ui-ux-agent expertise
- **User journey validation** using @user-journey-agent insights  
- **Parallel development** without interference between POCs
- **Coordinated validation** ensuring all POCs demonstrate successfully

## Parallel Execution Strategy

### Agent Orchestration Pattern

For **N POCs** discovered, create **N execution pairs**:
- **N UI-UX Implementation Agents**: Each building the specific UI approach
- **N User Journey Validation Agents**: Each ensuring journey flows work correctly

**Execution Agent Assignment:**
```yaml
POC 1: @ui-ux-agent (Build minimal/clean interface) + @user-journey-agent (Validate power user flows)
POC 2: @ui-ux-agent (Build polished/professional interface) + @user-journey-agent (Validate casual user flows)
POC 3: @ui-ux-agent (Build experimental/modern interface) + @user-journey-agent (Validate admin user flows)
POC 4: @ui-ux-agent (Build dashboard/data-heavy interface) + @user-journey-agent (Validate mobile-first flows)
POC 5: @ui-ux-agent (Build component-library interface) + @user-journey-agent (Validate accessibility flows)
```

## Pre-Execution Setup

### Step 1: Environment Preparation

1. **Create Fresh React Project**
   ```bash
   npx create-react-app react-poc-demos --template typescript
   cd react-poc-demos
   npm install react-router-dom @faker-js/faker msw
   npm install -D @types/react-router-dom
   ```

2. **Discover POC PRPs**
   - Scan for POC PRP files matching the pattern
   - Extract POC specifications and requirements
   - Plan directory structure and routing

3. **Setup Project Structure**
   ```
   src/
   ├── components/
   │   └── shared/        # Shared components across POCs
   ├── data/
   │   └── mocks/         # Shared mock data
   ├── poc-{name}-{variant}/
   │   ├── components/    # POC-specific components
   │   ├── pages/         # POC-specific pages
   │   ├── hooks/         # POC-specific hooks
   │   └── styles/        # POC-specific styles
   └── App.tsx           # Main navigation hub
   ```

## Parallel Implementation Process

### Step 2: Simultaneous POC Development

**Execute all implementation pairs in PARALLEL using Task tool:**

```yaml
# For each discovered POC, spawn specialized agent pair
Task 1 - @ui-ux-agent Implementation for POC 1:
"Read and implement PRP: 'PRPs/poc-{name}-{variant1}.md'
Focus on: Building the UI components and styling specified in the PRP.
Requirements:
- Follow the UI approach defined in the PRP context
- Implement all components with TypeScript interfaces
- Apply the styling approach (minimal/clean as specified)
- Create responsive layouts following the PRP requirements
- Use mock data integration as specified
Directory: src/poc-{name}-{variant1}/
Return: Complete UI implementation with all components functional"

Task 2 - @user-journey-agent Validation for POC 1:
"Read and validate PRP implementation: 'PRPs/poc-{name}-{variant1}.md'
Focus on: Ensuring user journey flows work as specified in the PRP.
Requirements:
- Test all user interactions defined in the PRP
- Validate navigation flows and state management
- Ensure mock data scenarios cover user journey requirements
- Test user flow completion from start to finish
- Document any journey friction points discovered
Directory: src/poc-{name}-{variant1}/
Return: Journey validation report and any flow improvements needed"

Task 3 - @ui-ux-agent Implementation for POC 2:
"Read and implement PRP: 'PRPs/poc-{name}-{variant2}.md'
Focus on: Building the UI components and styling specified in the PRP.
Requirements:
- Follow the UI approach defined in the PRP context (polished/professional)
- Implement all components with premium aesthetics
- Create brand-aligned styling and professional presentation
- Build stakeholder-ready demonstration interface
- Integrate realistic mock data for presentations
Directory: src/poc-{name}-{variant2}/
Return: Complete UI implementation with professional polish"

Task 4 - @user-journey-agent Validation for POC 2:
"Read and validate PRP implementation: 'PRPs/poc-{name}-{variant2}.md'
Focus on: Ensuring casual user journey flows work intuitively.
Requirements:
- Test simplified navigation and guided experiences
- Validate progressive disclosure and help systems
- Ensure beginner-friendly interaction patterns work
- Test complete user onboarding and guidance flows
- Document usability for non-expert users
Directory: src/poc-{name}-{variant2}/
Return: Casual user validation report and usability assessment"

# Continue pattern for all discovered POCs...
```

### Step 3: Main Navigation Implementation

**After all POCs are built, create navigation hub:**

```typescript
// App.tsx - Main navigation between POCs
import React from 'react'
import { BrowserRouter as Router, Routes, Route } from 'react-router-dom'
import POCNavigationHub from './components/POCNavigationHub'

// Import all POC entry points (generated dynamically based on discovered POCs)
const pocRoutes = [
  { path: '/poc-1', component: lazy(() => import('./poc-{name}-{variant1}/pages/Demo')), title: 'Minimal Power User' },
  { path: '/poc-2', component: lazy(() => import('./poc-{name}-{variant2}/pages/Demo')), title: 'Polished Casual User' },
  // ... additional routes for all POCs
]

function App() {
  return (
    <Router>
      <Routes>
        <Route path="/" element={<POCNavigationHub pocs={pocRoutes} />} />
        {pocRoutes.map(({ path, component: Component }) => (
          <Route key={path} path={path} element={<Suspense><Component /></Suspense>} />
        ))}
      </Routes>
    </Router>
  )
}
```

### Step 4: Coordinated Validation

**Execute validation for all POCs simultaneously:**

1. **Technical Validation (All POCs)**
   ```bash
   npm run lint          # All POCs pass linting
   npm run type-check    # All TypeScript errors resolved
   npm run build         # Production build succeeds
   npm run test          # All POC smoke tests pass
   ```

2. **Functional Validation (Per POC)**
   - Each POC loads without errors
   - Core user journeys navigable in each POC
   - Mock data displays correctly in all variations
   - Navigation between POCs works seamlessly

3. **User Journey Validation (Agent-Specific)**
   - Power user flows efficient and feature-complete
   - Casual user flows intuitive and guided
   - Admin flows comprehensive and control-focused  
   - Mobile flows touch-optimized and responsive
   - Accessibility flows screen reader compatible

## Coordination & Conflict Resolution

### Step 5: Integration Management

1. **Shared Resource Coordination**
   - Merge shared mock data without conflicts
   - Resolve common component naming conflicts
   - Integrate shared utilities and hooks
   - Coordinate routing and navigation structure

2. **Style Isolation**
   - Ensure POC-specific styles don't interfere
   - Use CSS modules or styled-components for isolation
   - Coordinate shared design system tokens
   - Resolve competing global styles

3. **Dependency Management**
   - Consolidate common dependencies
   - Resolve version conflicts between POC requirements
   - Optimize bundle size across all POCs
   - Manage shared vs POC-specific packages

## Anti-Patterns

### Execution Anti-Patterns
- ❌ **Don't execute POCs sequentially**: Use parallel agent execution always
- ❌ **Don't ignore agent specialization**: UI-UX and User Journey agents have distinct roles
- ❌ **Don't rush validation**: Each POC needs proper testing and verification
- ❌ **Don't skip integration testing**: Cross-POC navigation and shared resources need validation

### Coordination Anti-Patterns  
- ❌ **Don't allow POC interference**: Maintain isolation between implementations
- ❌ **Don't duplicate shared logic**: Coordinate common utilities and mock data
- ❌ **Don't ignore conflicts**: Resolve dependency and styling conflicts early
- ❌ **Don't skip demo preparation**: Stakeholder presentation needs coordination

### DO Focus On
- ✅ **Specialized agent utilization**: Leverage UI-UX and User Journey expertise fully
- ✅ **Parallel execution efficiency**: Maximum development speed through coordination
- ✅ **Cross-POC consistency**: Shared infrastructure and navigation experience
- ✅ **Business value delivery**: Each POC provides unique insights for decision making
