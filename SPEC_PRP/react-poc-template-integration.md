## Implementation Strategy

### Dependencies and Ordering
1. **Rapid Agent Foundation**: RapidPrototyper agent and mock data generation are prerequisites
2. **Speed Optimization**: Rapid validation and component scaffolding enable fast development
3. **Parallel Orchestration**: POC orchestrator coordinates multiple development streams
4. **Intelligence Layer**: Mock API and schema analysis enhance realism and consistency
5. **Deployment Integration**: Deployment engine and feedback collection complete the cycle

### Progressive Enhancement Approach
- Phase 1-2: Basic rapid development automation with speed-optimized validation
- Phase 3-4: Parallel development and intelligent mock data capabilities
- Phase 5-6: Complete deployment cycle with feedback integration

### Rollback Strategy
- Original POC template remains functional for manual development
- Agent automation can be disabled with manual fallback options
- Mock data generation defaults to manual creation if automation fails
- Parallel development can fall back to single POC option

## Risk Assessment and Mitigations

### Technical Risks

risk_1:
  description: "Speed optimization may compromise code quality beyond acceptable limits"
