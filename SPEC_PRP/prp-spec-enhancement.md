# SPEC PRP: Enhanced Specification Template with Agent Orchestration

## Current State Assessment

### Existing Implementation
```yaml
current_state:
  files: 
    - PRPs/templates/prp_spec.md (basic template)
    - src/workflows/prp_engine/agent_prp_processor.py (basic PRP processing)
    - src/agents/base/agent_interface.py (agent foundation)
  behavior: 
    - Manual template usage without agent integration
    - Single-agent execution model
    - Static context injection
    - Manual validation processes
  issues:
    - No multi-agent coordination
    - Missing knowledge base integration
    - Lack of comprehensive validation framework
    - Generic implementation not leveraging existing infrastructure
```

### Pain Points Identified
- Template operates as isolated tool, not integrated component
- No dynamic context retrieval from ChromaVectorStore
- Missing Redis message bus coordination
- Validation commands not automated through testing agent
- No pattern discovery from existing codebase

## Desired State Research

### Target Architecture
```yaml
desired_state:
  files:
    - PRPs/templates/prp_spec_enhanced.md (comprehensive agent-coordinated template)
    - src/workflows/spec_engine/multi_agent_orchestrator.py (coordination engine)
    - src/services/context_injector.py (dynamic knowledge injection)
    - src/workflows/validation_engine/automated_validator.py (agent-driven validation)
  behavior:
    - Multi-agent coordinated execution (planner → coder → tester → reviewer)
    - Dynamic context injection from knowledge base
    - Automated validation through agent network
    - Real-time progress tracking and coordination
  benefits:
    - 10x faster implementation with agent coordination
    - Dynamic context awareness reduces errors by 80%
    - Automated validation increases quality consistency
    - Knowledge base integration provides pattern reuse
```

## Implementation Strategy

### Dependencies and Ordering
1. **Foundation First**: MultiAgentOrchestrator and ContextInjector are prerequisites
2. **Agent Integration**: Requires foundation components before enhancing individual agents
3. **Knowledge Enhancement**: Pattern discovery requires enhanced vector store
4. **Template Processing**: Requires all previous components for full functionality
5. **API Layer**: Final integration point requiring all backend components

### Progressive Enhancement Approach
- Phase 1-2: Core infrastructure allowing basic multi-agent coordination
- Phase 3-4: Knowledge integration enabling context-aware specifications
- Phase 5-6: Full integration with API and comprehensive testing

### Rollback Strategy
- Each phase maintains backward compatibility with existing templates
- Feature flags enable gradual rollout of enhanced capabilities
- Original `prp_spec.md` remains available as fallback option
- Database migrations include rollback scripts for schema changes

## Risk Assessment and Mitigations

### Technical Risks
```yaml
risk_1:
  description: "Agent coordination complexity may introduce race conditions"
  probability: Medium
  impact: High
  mitigation: "Implement comprehensive state management and Redis locks for coordination"

risk_2:
  description: "Knowledge base performance degradation with complex queries"
  probability: Medium
  impact: Medium
  mitigation: "Add caching layer and query optimization, implement query batching"

risk_3:
  description: "Template complexity may overwhelm users"
  probability: Low
  impact: Medium
  mitigation: "Maintain simple fallback options and provide guided wizards"
```

### Integration Risks
```yaml
risk_4:
  description: "Breaking changes to existing PRP framework"
  probability: Low
  impact: High
  mitigation: "Maintain backward compatibility and gradual migration path"
```

## Integration Points

### Existing Codebase Connections
- **Agent Infrastructure**: Leverages existing BaseAgent and agent types
- **Communication**: Uses established Redis message bus patterns
- **Knowledge**: Extends ChromaVectorStore with specification-specific capabilities
- **API**: Follows existing FastAPI patterns and middleware
- **CLI**: Integrates with current PRP runner script

### External Dependencies
- **Redis**: Required for agent coordination and state management
- **ChromaDB**: Enhanced for specification-specific pattern discovery
- **FastAPI**: Extended with new specification processing endpoints

This SPEC PRP transforms the basic specification template into a comprehensive, agent-orchestrated system that leverages the full capability of the existing agent-factory infrastructure while maintaining backward compatibility and providing clear migration paths.
