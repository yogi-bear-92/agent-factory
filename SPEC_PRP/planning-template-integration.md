# SPEC PRP: Planning Template Agent Integration

## Current State Assessment

### Existing Implementation
```yaml
current_state:
  files:
    - PRPs/templates/prp_planning.md (comprehensive planning template)
    - src/agents/planner/feature_planner.py (basic planning agent)
    - src/workflows/prp_engine/agent_prp_processor.py (basic processing)
  behavior:
    - Manual template usage for PRD generation
    - Static mermaid diagram creation
    - Manual research and context gathering
    - No integration with planner agent or knowledge base
  issues:
    - Excellent planning template operates in isolation
    - Research phase not automated or connected to knowledge infrastructure
    - Diagram generation not integrated with automated workflow
    - No coordination between planning and implementation phases
```

### Current Template Strengths
- Comprehensive research-first approach with market analysis
- Visual diagram integration (mermaid) for all planning aspects
- Progressive refinement from concept to implementation-ready PRD
- Built-in devil's advocate analysis and challenge validation

    - PRPs/templates/prp_planning_enhanced.md (agent-integrated template)
  behavior:
    - Automated research coordination across multiple sources
    - Dynamic diagram generation based on analysis
    - Intelligent PRD structuring with context injection
    - Seamless transition from planning to implementation PRPs
  benefits:

## Implementation Strategy

### Dependencies and Ordering
1. **Research Infrastructure First**: Research coordination and automation enable all other components
2. **Diagram Intelligence**: Automated diagram generation requires research foundation
3. **Content Generation**: PRD structure and content intelligence require research and diagram capabilities
4. **Workflow Orchestration**: PRD generation engine coordinates all components
5. **Integration Layer**: Bridge and API integration as final user-facing components

### Progressive Enhancement Approach
- Phase 1-2: Automated research and diagram generation
- Phase 3-4: Intelligent PRD structuring and workflow orchestration
- Phase 5-7: Challenge analysis, implementation bridge, and user interfaces

### Rollback Strategy
- Original planning template remains fully functional
- Research automation can be disabled with manual fallback
- Diagram generation defaults to manual mermaid creation if automation fails
- Feature flags enable gradual rollout of automation capabilities

## Risk Assessment and Mitigations

### Technical Risks
```yaml
risk_1:
  description: "Automated research may miss nuanced industry insights"
  probability: Medium
  impact: Medium
  mitigation: "Combine automated research with human review gates and expert input validation"

risk_2:
  description: "Diagram generation may create overly complex or unclear visuals"
  probability: Medium
  impact: Low
  mitigation: "Implement diagram simplification algorithms and human review for critical diagrams"

risk_3:
  description: "PRD quality may suffer without human creative input"
  probability: Low
  impact: Medium
  mitigation: "Maintain human review stages and creative input opportunities throughout process"
```
