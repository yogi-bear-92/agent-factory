# Get started with Claude Code hooks

> Learn how to customize and extend Claude Code's behavior by registering shell commands

Claude Code hooks are user-defined shell commands that execute at various points
in Claude Code's lifecycle. Hooks provide deterministic control over Claude
Code's behavior, ensuring certain actions always happen rather than relying on
the LLM to choose to run them.

<Tip>
  For reference documentation on hooks, see [Hooks reference](/en/docs/claude-code/hooks).
</Tip>

Example use cases for hooks include:

- **Notifications**: Customize how you get notified when Claude Code is awaiting
  your input or permission to run something.
- **Automatic formatting**: Run `prettier` on .ts files, `gofmt` on .go files,
  etc. after every file edit.
- **Logging**: Track and count all executed commands for compliance or
  debugging.
- **Feedback**: Provide automated feedback when Claude Code produces code that
  does not follow your codebase conventions.
- **Custom permissions**: Block modifications to production files or sensitive
  directories.

By encoding these rules as hooks rather than prompting instructions, you turn
suggestions into app-level code that executes every time it is expected to run.

<Warning>
  You must consider the security implication of hooks as you add them, because hooks run automatically during the agent loop with your current environment's credentials.
  For example, malicious hooks code can exfiltrate your data. Always review your hooks implementation before registering them.

For full security best practices, see [Security Considerations](/en/docs/claude-code/hooks#security-considerations) in the hooks reference documentation.
</Warning>

## Hook Events Overview

Claude Code provides several hook events that run at different points in the
workflow:

- **PreToolUse**: Runs before tool calls (can block them)
- **PostToolUse**: Runs after tool calls complete
- **Notification**: Runs when Claude Code sends notifications
- **Stop**: Runs when Claude Code finishes responding
- **Subagent Stop**: Runs when subagent tasks complete

Each event receives different data and can control Claude's behavior in
different ways.

## Quickstart

In this quickstart, you'll add a hook that logs the shell commands that Claude
Code runs.

### Prerequisites

Install `jq` for JSON processing in the command line.

### Step 1: Open hooks configuration

Run the `/hooks` [slash command](/en/docs/claude-code/slash-commands) and select
the `PreToolUse` hook event.

`PreToolUse` hooks run before tool calls and can block them while providing
Claude feedback on what to do differently.

### Step 2: Add a matcher

Select `+ Add new matcher…` to run your hook only on Bash tool calls.

Type `Bash` for the matcher.

<Note>You can use `*` to match all tools.</Note>

### Step 3: Add the hook

Select `+ Add new hook…` and enter this command:

```bash
jq -r '"\(.tool_input.command) - \(.tool_input.description // "No description")"' >> ~/.claude/bash-command-log.txt
```

### Step 4: Save your configuration

For storage location, select `User settings` since you're logging to your home
directory. This hook will then apply to all projects, not just your current
project.

Then press Esc until you return to the REPL. Your hook is now registered!

### Step 5: Verify your hook

Run `/hooks` again or check `~/.claude/settings.json` to see your configuration:

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "PreToolUse": [
      {
        "matcher": "Bash",
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "jq -r '\"\\(.tool_input.command) - \\(.tool_input.description // \"No description\")\"' >> ~/.claude/bash-command-log.txt"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### Step 6: Test your hook

Ask Claude to run a simple command like `ls` and check your log file:

```bash
cat ~/.claude/bash-command-log.txt
```

You should see entries like:

```
ls - Lists files and directories
```

## More Examples

</Note>

### Code Formatting Hook

Automatically format TypeScript files after editing:

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "PostToolUse": [
      {
        "matcher": "Edit|MultiEdit|Write",
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "jq -r '.tool_input.file_path' | { read file_path; if echo \"$file_path\" | grep -q '\\.ts$'; then npx prettier --write \"$file_path\"; fi; }"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### Custom Notification Hook

Get desktop notifications when Claude needs input:

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "Notification": [
      {
        "matcher": "",
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "notify-send 'Claude Code' 'Awaiting your input'"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### File Protection Hook

Block edits to sensitive files:

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "PreToolUse": [
      {
        "matcher": "Edit|MultiEdit|Write",
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "python3 -c \"import json, sys; data=json.load(sys.stdin); path=data.get('tool_input',{}).get('file_path',''); sys.exit(2 if any(p in path for p in ['.env', 'package-lock.json', '.git/']) else 0)\""
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```
