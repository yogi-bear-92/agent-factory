# Agent Factory Project Overview

## Project Purpose
The **agent-factory** is an AI Agent Factory enhanced with the **PRP (Product Requirement Prompt) Framework**. The core concept: **"PRP = PRD + curated codebase intelligence + agent/runbook"** - designed to enable AI agents to ship production-ready code on the first pass.

## Core Goals
- Enable one-pass implementation success through comprehensive context and validation
- Command-driven development with pre-configured Claude Code workflows
- Template-based methodology with structured validation loops
- AI documentation curation for context injection into AI workflows

## Key Features
- **Multi-Agent Development**: Specialized AI agents that collaborate to develop software autonomously
- **PRP Framework**: Product Requirement Prompts that combine PRD with curated codebase intelligence
- **Command System**: 35+ pre-configured Claude Code commands organized by function
- **Template Library**: Structured PRP templates with validation gates
- **MCP Integration**: Multiple MCP servers (serena, archon, browsermcp) for enhanced capabilities

## Target Users
- Development teams wanting to accelerate software delivery
- Software architects designing AI-driven development workflows
- Organizations looking to automate software creation processes

## Current Status
Framework is ready for implementing the Agent-Driven Autonomous Development Framework which will create a complete multi-agent system for autonomous software development.
